1. The command below requires escaping the space in the argument to the
--using option.  It shouldn't because it's in single quotes, so the shell
is passing the full string as --using's argument.  It's bzr that is
treating an unescaped space as a delimiter between two tokens, not the
shell.

    $ bzr diff --using='c:/Program\ Files/TortoiseSVN/bin/TortoiseMerge.exe' bzrlib/diff.py

2. When invoking bzr from a source directory in a Cygwin Bash shell, using
an external diff program that is a native Windows program doesn't work.
The native Windows program can't find the "new" version of the comparison
because bzr uses a symbolic link instead of copying the relevant files.

I implemented a quick fix, but I need to make it a Cygwin-specific
workaround.

Idea: perhaps bzr should retrieve the physical path for each file and use that instead of the logical (symlink) path.
