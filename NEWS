DEVELOPMENT HEAD

  NEW FEATURES:

    * Python plugins, automatically loaded from the directories on
      BZR_PLUGIN_PATH or ~/.bzr.conf/plugins by default.

    * New 'bzr mkdir' command.

    * Commit mesage is fetched from an editor if not given on the
      command line; patch from Torsten Marek.

    * ``bzr log -m FOO`` displays commits whose message matches regexp 
      FOO.
      
    * ``bzr add`` with no arguments adds everything under the current directory.

    * ``bzr mv`` does move or rename depending on its arguments, like
      the Unix command.
    
  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Faster working tree operations.

  CHANGES:

    * When exporting to a tarball with ``bzr export --format tgz``, put 
      everything under a top directory rather than dumping it into the
      current directory.   This can be overridden with the ``--root`` 
      option.  Patch from William Dodé and John Meinel.

    * New ``bzr upgrade`` command to upgrade the format of a branch,
      replacing ``bzr check --update``.

    * Files within store directories are no longer marked readonly on
      disk.

    * Changed ``bzr log`` output to a more compact form suggested by
      John A Meinel.  Old format is available with the ``--long`` or
      ``-l`` option, patched by William Dodé.

    * By default the commit command refuses to record a revision with
      no changes unless the ``--unchanged`` option is given.

    * The ``--no-plugins``, ``--profile`` and ``--builtin`` command
      line options must come before the command name because they 
      affect what commands are available; all other options must come 
      after the command name because their interpretation depends on
      it.

    * ``branch`` and ``clone`` added as aliases for ``branch``.
      
      
  BUG FIXES:
  
    * Fix bugs in committing only selected files or within a subdirectory.


bzr-0.0.5  2005-06-15
  
  CHANGES:

    * ``bzr`` with no command now shows help rather than giving an
      error.  Suggested by Michael Ellerman.

    * ``bzr status`` output format changed, because svn-style output
      doesn't really match the model of bzr.  Now files are grouped by
      status and can be shown with their IDs.  ``bzr status --all``
      shows all versioned files and unknown files but not ignored files.

    * ``bzr log`` runs from most-recent to least-recent, the reverse
      of the previous order.  The previous behaviour can be obtained
      with the ``--forward`` option.
        
    * ``bzr inventory`` by default shows only filenames, and also ids
      if ``--show-ids`` is given, in which case the id is the second
      field.


  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * New 'bzr whoami --email' option shows only the email component
      of the user identification, from Jo Vermeulen.

    * New ``bzr ignore PATTERN`` command.

    * Nicer error message for broken pipe, interrupt and similar
      conditions that don't indicate an internal error.

    * Add ``.*.sw[nop] .git .*.tmp *,v`` to default ignore patterns.

    * Per-branch locks keyed on ``.bzr/branch-lock``, available in
      either read or write mode.

    * New option ``bzr log --show-ids`` shows revision and file ids.

    * New usage ``bzr log FILENAME`` shows only revisions that
      affected that file.

    * Changed format for describing changes in ``bzr log -v``.

    * New option ``bzr commit --file`` to take a message from a file,
      suggested by LarstiQ.

    * New syntax ``bzr status [FILE...]`` contributed by Bartosz
      Oler.  File may be in a branch other than the working directory.

    * ``bzr log`` and ``bzr root`` can be given an http URL instead of
      a filename.

    * Commands can now be defined by external programs or scripts
      in a directory on $BZRPATH.

    * New "stat cache" avoids reading the contents of files if they 
      haven't changed since the previous time.

    * If the Python interpreter is too old, try to find a better one
      or give an error.  Based on a patch from Fredrik Lundh.

    * New optional parameter ``bzr info [BRANCH]``.

    * New form ``bzr commit SELECTED`` to commit only selected files.

    * New form ``bzr log -r FROM:TO`` shows changes in selected
      range; contributed by John A Meinel.

    * New option ``bzr diff --diff-options 'OPTS'`` allows passing
      options through to an external GNU diff.

    * New option ``bzr add --no-recurse`` to add a directory but not
      their contents.

    * ``bzr --version`` now shows more information if bzr is being run
      from a branch.

  
  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed diff format so that added and removed files will be
      handled properly by patch.  Fix from Lalo Martins.

    * Various fixes for files whose names contain spaces or other
      metacharacters.


  TESTING:

    * Converted black-box test suites from Bourne shell into Python;
      now run using ``./testbzr``.  Various structural improvements to
      the tests.

    * testbzr by default runs the version of bzr found in the same
      directory as the tests, or the one given as the first parameter.

    * testbzr also runs the internal tests, so the only command
      required to check is just ``./testbzr``.

    * testbzr requires python2.4, but can be used to test bzr running
      under a different version.

    * Tests added for many other changes in this release.


  INTERNAL:

    * Included ElementTree library upgraded to 1.2.6 by Fredrik Lundh.

    * Refactor command functions into Command objects based on HCT by
      Scott James Remnant.

    * Better help messages for many commands.

    * Expose bzrlib.open_tracefile() to start the tracefile; until
      this is called trace messages are just discarded.

    * New internal function find_touching_revisions() and hidden
      command touching-revisions trace the changes to a given file.

    * Simpler and faster compare_inventories() function.

    * bzrlib.open_tracefile() takes a tracefilename parameter.

    * New AtomicFile class.

    * New developer commands ``added``, ``modified``.


  PORTABILITY:

    * Cope on Windows on python2.3 by using the weaker random seed.
      2.4 is now only recommended.


bzr-0.0.4  2005-04-22

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * 'bzr diff' optionally takes a list of files to diff.  Still a bit
      basic.  Patch from QuantumG.

    * More default ignore patterns.

    * New 'bzr log --verbose' shows a list of files changed in the
      changeset.  Patch from Sebastian Cote.

    * Roll over ~/.bzr.log if it gets too large.

    * Command abbreviations 'ci', 'st', 'stat', '?' based on a patch
      by Jason Diamon.

    * New 'bzr help commands' based on a patch from Denys Duchier.


  CHANGES:

    * User email is determined by looking at $BZREMAIL or ~/.bzr.email
      or $EMAIL.  All are decoded by the locale preferred encoding.
      If none of these are present user@hostname is used.  The host's
      fully-qualified name is not used because that tends to fail when
      there are DNS problems.

    * New 'bzr whoami' command instead of username user-email.


  BUG FIXES: 

    * Make commit safe for hardlinked bzr trees.

    * Some Unicode/locale fixes.

    * Partial workaround for difflib.unified_diff not handling
      trailing newlines properly.


  INTERNAL:

    * Allow docstrings for help to be in PEP0257 format.  Patch from
      Matt Brubeck.

    * More tests in test.sh.

    * Write profile data to a temporary file not into working
      directory and delete it when done.

    * Smaller .bzr.log with process ids.


  PORTABILITY:

    * Fix opening of ~/.bzr.log on Windows.  Patch from Andrew
      Bennetts.

    * Some improvements in handling paths on Windows, based on a patch
      from QuantumG.


bzr-0.0.3  2005-04-06

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * New "directories" internal command lists versioned directories
      in the tree.

    * Can now say "bzr commit --help".

    * New "rename" command to rename one file to a different name
      and/or directory.

    * New "move" command to move one or more files into a different
      directory.

    * New "renames" command lists files renamed since base revision.

    * New cat command contributed by janmar.

  CHANGES:

    * .bzr.log is placed in $HOME (not pwd) and is always written in
      UTF-8.  (Probably not a completely good long-term solution, but
      will do for now.)

  PORTABILITY:

    * Workaround for difflib bug in Python 2.3 that causes an
      exception when comparing empty files.  Reported by Erik Toubro
      Nielsen.

  INTERNAL:

    * Refactored inventory storage to insert a root entry at the top.

  TESTING:

    * Start of shell-based black-box testing in test.sh.


bzr-0.0.2.1

  PORTABILITY:

    * Win32 fixes from Steve Brown.


bzr-0.0.2  "black cube"  2005-03-31

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Default ignore list extended (see bzrlib/__init__.py).

    * Patterns in .bzrignore are now added to the default ignore list,
      rather than replacing it.

    * Ignore list isn't reread for every file.

    * More help topics.

    * Reinstate the 'bzr check' command to check invariants of the
      branch.

    * New 'ignored' command lists which files are ignored and why;
      'deleted' lists files deleted in the current working tree.

    * Performance improvements.

    * New global --profile option.
    
    * Ignore patterns like './config.h' now correctly match files in
      the root directory only.


bzr-0.0.1  2005-03-26

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * More information from info command.

    * Can now say "bzr help COMMAND" for more detailed help.

    * Less file flushing and faster performance when writing logs and
      committing to stores.

    * More useful verbose output from some commands.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix inverted display of 'R' and 'M' during 'commit -v'.

  PORTABILITY:

    * Include a subset of ElementTree-1.2.20040618 to make
      installation easier.

    * Fix time.localtime call to work with Python 2.3 (the minimum
      supported).


bzr-0.0.0.69  2005-03-22

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * First public release.

    * Storage of local versions: init, add, remove, rm, info, log,
      diff, status, etc.
