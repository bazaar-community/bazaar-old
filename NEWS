development head

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Status now accepted a -r argument to give status between chosen
      revisions. Contributed by Heikki Paajanen.

    * Revision arguments no longer use +/-/= to control ranges, instead
      there is a 'before' namespace, which limits the successive namespace.
      For example '$ bzr log -r date:yesterday..before:date:today' will
      select everything from yesterday and before today. Contributed by
      Robey Pointer

    * There is now a bzr.bat file created by distutils when building on 
      Windows. Contributed by Alexander Belchenko.

    * New tree format based on weave files, called version 5.
      Existing branches can be upgraded to this format using 
      'bzr upgrade'.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Various minor bug in windows support have been fixed, largely in the
      test suite. Contributed by Alexander Belchenko.
      
  INTERNALS:

    * Removed uuid() as it was unused.

    * Improved 'fetch' code for pulling revisions from one branch into
      another (used by pull, merged, etc.)


bzr 0.0.8 2005-09-20

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Adding a file whose parent directory is not versioned will
      implicitly add the parent, and so on up to the root. This means
      you should never need to explictly add a directory, they'll just
      get added when you add a file in the directory.  Contributed by
      Michael Ellerman.

    * Ignore .DS_Store (contains Mac metadata) by default.  Patch from
      Nir Soffer.

    * If you set BZR_EDITOR in the environment, it is checked in
      preference to EDITOR and the config file for the interactive commit
      editing program. Related to this is a bugfix where a missing program
      set in EDITOR would cause editing to fail, now the fallback program
      for the operating system is still tried.

    * Files that are not directories/symlinks/regular files will no longer
      cause bzr to fail, it will just ignore them by default. You cannot add
      them to the tree though - they are not versionable.


  INTERNALS:

    * Refactor xml packing/unpacking.

  BUG FIXES: 

    * Fixed 'bzr mv' by Ollie Rutherfurd.

    * Fixed strange error when trying to access a nonexistent http
      branch.

    * Make sure that the hashcache gets written out if it can't be
      read.


  PORTABILITY:

    * Various Windows fixes from Ollie Rutherfurd.

    * Quieten warnings about locking; patch from Matt Lavin.


bzr-0.0.7 2005-09-02

  NEW FEATURES:

    * ``bzr shell-complete`` command contributed by Clint Adams to
      help with intelligent shell completion.

    * New expert command ``bzr find-merge-base`` for debugging merges.


  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Much better merge support.

    * merge3 conflicts are now reported with markers like '<<<<<<<'
      (seven characters) which is the same as CVS and pleases things
      like emacs smerge.


  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzr upgrade`` no longer fails when trying to fix trees that
      mention revisions that are not present.

    * Fixed bugs in listing plugins from ``bzr plugins``.

    * Fix case of $EDITOR containing options for the editor.

    * Fix log -r refusing to show the last revision.
      (Patch from Goffredo Baroncelli.)


  CHANGES:

    * ``bzr log --show-ids`` shows the revision ids of all parents.

    * Externally provided commands on your $BZRPATH no longer need
      to recognize --bzr-usage to work properly, and can just handle
      --help themselves.


  LIBRARY:

    * Changed trace messages to go through the standard logging
      framework, so that they can more easily be redirected by
      libraries.



bzr-0.0.6 2005-08-18

  NEW FEATURES:

    * Python plugins, automatically loaded from the directories on
      BZR_PLUGIN_PATH or ~/.bzr.conf/plugins by default.

    * New 'bzr mkdir' command.

    * Commit mesage is fetched from an editor if not given on the
      command line; patch from Torsten Marek.

    * ``bzr log -m FOO`` displays commits whose message matches regexp 
      FOO.
      
    * ``bzr add`` with no arguments adds everything under the current directory.

    * ``bzr mv`` does move or rename depending on its arguments, like
      the Unix command.

    * ``bzr missing`` command shows a summary of the differences
      between two trees.  (Merged from John Arbash-Meinel.)

    * An email address for commits to a particular tree can be
      specified by putting it into .bzr/email within a branch.  (Based
      on a patch from Heikki Paajanen.)


  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Faster working tree operations.


  CHANGES:

    * 3rd-party modules shipped with bzr are copied within the bzrlib
      python package, so that they can be installed by the setup
      script without clashing with anything already existing on the
      system.  (Contributed by Gustavo Niemeyer.)

    * Moved plugins directory to bzrlib/, so that there's a standard
      plugin directory which is not only installed with bzr itself but
      is also available when using bzr from the development tree.
      BZR_PLUGIN_PATH and DEFAULT_PLUGIN_PATH are then added to the
      standard plugins directory.

    * When exporting to a tarball with ``bzr export --format tgz``, put 
      everything under a top directory rather than dumping it into the
      current directory.   This can be overridden with the ``--root`` 
      option.  Patch from William Dodé and John Meinel.

    * New ``bzr upgrade`` command to upgrade the format of a branch,
      replacing ``bzr check --update``.

    * Files within store directories are no longer marked readonly on
      disk.

    * Changed ``bzr log`` output to a more compact form suggested by
      John A Meinel.  Old format is available with the ``--long`` or
      ``-l`` option, patched by William Dodé.

    * By default the commit command refuses to record a revision with
      no changes unless the ``--unchanged`` option is given.

    * The ``--no-plugins``, ``--profile`` and ``--builtin`` command
      line options must come before the command name because they 
      affect what commands are available; all other options must come 
      after the command name because their interpretation depends on
      it.

    * ``branch`` and ``clone`` added as aliases for ``branch``.

    * Default log format is back to the long format; the compact one
      is available with ``--short``.
      
      
  BUG FIXES:
  
    * Fix bugs in committing only selected files or within a subdirectory.


bzr-0.0.5  2005-06-15
  
  CHANGES:

    * ``bzr`` with no command now shows help rather than giving an
      error.  Suggested by Michael Ellerman.

    * ``bzr status`` output format changed, because svn-style output
      doesn't really match the model of bzr.  Now files are grouped by
      status and can be shown with their IDs.  ``bzr status --all``
      shows all versioned files and unknown files but not ignored files.

    * ``bzr log`` runs from most-recent to least-recent, the reverse
      of the previous order.  The previous behaviour can be obtained
      with the ``--forward`` option.
        
    * ``bzr inventory`` by default shows only filenames, and also ids
      if ``--show-ids`` is given, in which case the id is the second
      field.


  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * New 'bzr whoami --email' option shows only the email component
      of the user identification, from Jo Vermeulen.

    * New ``bzr ignore PATTERN`` command.

    * Nicer error message for broken pipe, interrupt and similar
      conditions that don't indicate an internal error.

    * Add ``.*.sw[nop] .git .*.tmp *,v`` to default ignore patterns.

    * Per-branch locks keyed on ``.bzr/branch-lock``, available in
      either read or write mode.

    * New option ``bzr log --show-ids`` shows revision and file ids.

    * New usage ``bzr log FILENAME`` shows only revisions that
      affected that file.

    * Changed format for describing changes in ``bzr log -v``.

    * New option ``bzr commit --file`` to take a message from a file,
      suggested by LarstiQ.

    * New syntax ``bzr status [FILE...]`` contributed by Bartosz
      Oler.  File may be in a branch other than the working directory.

    * ``bzr log`` and ``bzr root`` can be given an http URL instead of
      a filename.

    * Commands can now be defined by external programs or scripts
      in a directory on $BZRPATH.

    * New "stat cache" avoids reading the contents of files if they 
      haven't changed since the previous time.

    * If the Python interpreter is too old, try to find a better one
      or give an error.  Based on a patch from Fredrik Lundh.

    * New optional parameter ``bzr info [BRANCH]``.

    * New form ``bzr commit SELECTED`` to commit only selected files.

    * New form ``bzr log -r FROM:TO`` shows changes in selected
      range; contributed by John A Meinel.

    * New option ``bzr diff --diff-options 'OPTS'`` allows passing
      options through to an external GNU diff.

    * New option ``bzr add --no-recurse`` to add a directory but not
      their contents.

    * ``bzr --version`` now shows more information if bzr is being run
      from a branch.

  
  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed diff format so that added and removed files will be
      handled properly by patch.  Fix from Lalo Martins.

    * Various fixes for files whose names contain spaces or other
      metacharacters.


  TESTING:

    * Converted black-box test suites from Bourne shell into Python;
      now run using ``./testbzr``.  Various structural improvements to
      the tests.

    * testbzr by default runs the version of bzr found in the same
      directory as the tests, or the one given as the first parameter.

    * testbzr also runs the internal tests, so the only command
      required to check is just ``./testbzr``.

    * testbzr requires python2.4, but can be used to test bzr running
      under a different version.

    * Tests added for many other changes in this release.


  INTERNAL:

    * Included ElementTree library upgraded to 1.2.6 by Fredrik Lundh.

    * Refactor command functions into Command objects based on HCT by
      Scott James Remnant.

    * Better help messages for many commands.

    * Expose bzrlib.open_tracefile() to start the tracefile; until
      this is called trace messages are just discarded.

    * New internal function find_touching_revisions() and hidden
      command touching-revisions trace the changes to a given file.

    * Simpler and faster compare_inventories() function.

    * bzrlib.open_tracefile() takes a tracefilename parameter.

    * New AtomicFile class.

    * New developer commands ``added``, ``modified``.


  PORTABILITY:

    * Cope on Windows on python2.3 by using the weaker random seed.
      2.4 is now only recommended.


bzr-0.0.4  2005-04-22

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * 'bzr diff' optionally takes a list of files to diff.  Still a bit
      basic.  Patch from QuantumG.

    * More default ignore patterns.

    * New 'bzr log --verbose' shows a list of files changed in the
      changeset.  Patch from Sebastian Cote.

    * Roll over ~/.bzr.log if it gets too large.

    * Command abbreviations 'ci', 'st', 'stat', '?' based on a patch
      by Jason Diamon.

    * New 'bzr help commands' based on a patch from Denys Duchier.


  CHANGES:

    * User email is determined by looking at $BZREMAIL or ~/.bzr.email
      or $EMAIL.  All are decoded by the locale preferred encoding.
      If none of these are present user@hostname is used.  The host's
      fully-qualified name is not used because that tends to fail when
      there are DNS problems.

    * New 'bzr whoami' command instead of username user-email.


  BUG FIXES: 

    * Make commit safe for hardlinked bzr trees.

    * Some Unicode/locale fixes.

    * Partial workaround for difflib.unified_diff not handling
      trailing newlines properly.


  INTERNAL:

    * Allow docstrings for help to be in PEP0257 format.  Patch from
      Matt Brubeck.

    * More tests in test.sh.

    * Write profile data to a temporary file not into working
      directory and delete it when done.

    * Smaller .bzr.log with process ids.


  PORTABILITY:

    * Fix opening of ~/.bzr.log on Windows.  Patch from Andrew
      Bennetts.

    * Some improvements in handling paths on Windows, based on a patch
      from QuantumG.


bzr-0.0.3  2005-04-06

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * New "directories" internal command lists versioned directories
      in the tree.

    * Can now say "bzr commit --help".

    * New "rename" command to rename one file to a different name
      and/or directory.

    * New "move" command to move one or more files into a different
      directory.

    * New "renames" command lists files renamed since base revision.

    * New cat command contributed by janmar.

  CHANGES:

    * .bzr.log is placed in $HOME (not pwd) and is always written in
      UTF-8.  (Probably not a completely good long-term solution, but
      will do for now.)

  PORTABILITY:

    * Workaround for difflib bug in Python 2.3 that causes an
      exception when comparing empty files.  Reported by Erik Toubro
      Nielsen.

  INTERNAL:

    * Refactored inventory storage to insert a root entry at the top.

  TESTING:

    * Start of shell-based black-box testing in test.sh.


bzr-0.0.2.1

  PORTABILITY:

    * Win32 fixes from Steve Brown.


bzr-0.0.2  "black cube"  2005-03-31

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Default ignore list extended (see bzrlib/__init__.py).

    * Patterns in .bzrignore are now added to the default ignore list,
      rather than replacing it.

    * Ignore list isn't reread for every file.

    * More help topics.

    * Reinstate the 'bzr check' command to check invariants of the
      branch.

    * New 'ignored' command lists which files are ignored and why;
      'deleted' lists files deleted in the current working tree.

    * Performance improvements.

    * New global --profile option.
    
    * Ignore patterns like './config.h' now correctly match files in
      the root directory only.


bzr-0.0.1  2005-03-26

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * More information from info command.

    * Can now say "bzr help COMMAND" for more detailed help.

    * Less file flushing and faster performance when writing logs and
      committing to stores.

    * More useful verbose output from some commands.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix inverted display of 'R' and 'M' during 'commit -v'.

  PORTABILITY:

    * Include a subset of ElementTree-1.2.20040618 to make
      installation easier.

    * Fix time.localtime call to work with Python 2.3 (the minimum
      supported).


bzr-0.0.0.69  2005-03-22

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * First public release.

    * Storage of local versions: init, add, remove, rm, info, log,
      diff, status, etc.
