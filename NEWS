UNRELEASED CHANGES

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * New 'bzr commit --strict' option refuses to commit if there are 
      any unknown files in the tree.  To commit, make sure all files are 
      either ignored, added, or deleted.  (Michael Ellerman)

    * The config directory is now ~/.bazaar, and there is a single file 
      ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf storing email, editor and other preferences.
      (Robert Collins)

    * 'bzr add' no longer takes a --verbose option, and a --quiet option
      has been added that suppresses all output.

    * Improved zsh completion support in contrib/zsh, from Clint
      Adams.

    * Builtin 'bzr annotate' command, by Martin Pool with improvements from 
      Goffredo Baroncelli.
    
    * 'bzr check' now accepts -v for verbose reporting, and checks for
      ghosts in the branch. (Robert Collins)

    * New command 're-sign' which will regenerate the gpg signature for 
      a revision. (Robert Collins)

    * If you set check_signatures=require for a path in 
      ~/.bazaar/branches.conf then bzr will invoke your
      gpg_signing_command (defaults to gpg) and record a digital signature
      of your commit. (Robert Collins)

    * 'bzr pull' now accepts '--clobber' which will discard local changes
      and make this branch identical to the source branch. (Robert Collins)

  TESTING:

    * The 'bzr selftest --pattern' option for has been removed, now 
      test specifiers on the command line can be simple strings, or 
      regexps, or both. (Robert Collins)

    * Passing -v to selftest will now show the time each test took to 
      complete, which will aid in analysing performance regressions and
      related questions. (Robert Collins)

    * 'bzr selftest' runs all tests, even if one feels, unless '--one'
      is given. (Martin Pool)

    * There is a new method for TestCaseInTempDir, assertFileEqual, which
      will check that a given content is equal to the content of the named
      file. (Robert Collins)

  INTERNALS:

    * New 'testament' command and concept for making gpg-signatures 
      of revisions that are not tied to a particular internal
      representation.  (Martin Pool).

    * Per-revision properties ('revprops') as key-value associated 
      strings on each revision created when the revision is committed.
      Intended mainly for the use of external tools.  (Martin Pool).

    * Config options have moved from bzrlib.osutils to bzrlib.config.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Improved command line option definitions allowing explanations
      for individual options, among other things.  Contributed by 
      Magnus Therning.

    * Config options have moved from bzrlib.osutils to bzrlib.config.
      Configuration is now done via the config.Config interface:
      Depending on whether you have a Branch, a Location or no information
      available, construct a *Config, and use its signature_checking,
      username and user_email methods. (Robert Collins)

    * Plugins are now loaded under bzrlib.plugins, not bzrlib.plugin, and
      they are made available for other plugins to use. You should not 
      import other plugins during the __init__ of your plugin though, as 
      no ordering is guaranteed, and the plugins directory is not on the
      python path. (Robert Collins)

    * Branch.relpath has been moved to WorkingTree.relpath. WorkingTree no
      no longer takes an inventory, rather it takes an option branch
      parameter, and if None is given will open the branch at basedir 
      implicitly. (Robert Collins)

    * Cleaner exception structure and error reporting.  Suggested by 
      Scott James Remnant.  (Martin Pool)

    * Branch.remove has been moved to WorkingTree, which has also gained
      lock_read, lock_write and unlock methods for convenience. (Robert
      Collins)

    * Two decorators, needs_read_lock and needs_write_lock have been added
      to the branch module. Use these to cause a function to run in a
      read or write lock respectively. (Robert Collins)

    * Branch.open_containing now returns a tuple (Branch, relative-path),
      which allows direct access to the common case of 'get me this file
      from its branch'. (Robert Collins)

    * 'pull' has been factored out of the command as WorkingTree.pull().
      A new option to WorkingTree.pull has been added, clobber, which will
      ignore diverged history and pull anyway.
      (Robert Collins)

    * config.Config has a 'get_user_option' call that accepts an option name.
      This will be looked up in branches.conf and bazaar.conf as normal.
      It is intended that this be used by plugins to support options - 
      options of built in programs should have specific methods on the config.
      (Robert Collins)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Better handling of branches in directories with non-ascii names. 
      (Joel Rosdahl, Panagiotis Papadakos)

bzr 0.1.1 2005-10-12

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix problem in pulling over http from machines that do not 
      allow directories to be listed.

    * Avoid harmless warning about invalid hash cache after 
      upgrading branch format.

  PERFORMANCE: 
  
    * Avoid some unnecessary http operations in branch and pull.


bzr 0.1 2005-10-11

  NOTES:

    * 'bzr branch' over http initially gives a very high estimate
      of completion time but it should fall as the first few 
      revisions are pulled in.  branch is still slow on 
      high-latency connections.

  BUG FIXES:
  
    * bzr-man.py has been updated to work again. Contributed by
      Rob Weir.

    * Locking is now done with fcntl.lockf which works with NFS
      file systems. Contributed by Harald Meland.

    * When a merge encounters a file that has been deleted on
      one side and modified on the other, the old contents are
      written out to foo.BASE and foo.SIDE, where SIDE is this
      or OTHER. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

    * Export was choosing incorrect file paths for the content of
      the tarball, this has been fixed by Aaron Bentley.

    * Commit will no longer commit without a log message, an 
      error is returned instead. Contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.

    * If you commit a specific file in a sub directory, any of its
      parent directories that are added but not listed will be 
      automatically included. Suggested by Michael Ellerman.

    * bzr commit and upgrade did not correctly record new revisions
      for files with only a change to their executable status.
      bzr will correct this when it encounters it. Fixed by
      Robert Collins

    * HTTP tests now force off the use of http_proxy for the duration.
      Contributed by Gustavo Niemeyer.

    * Fix problems in merging weave-based branches that have 
      different partial views of history.

    * Symlink support: working with symlinks when not in the root of a 
      bzr tree was broken, patch from Scott James Remnant.


  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * 'branch' now accepts a --basis parameter which will take advantage
      of local history when making a new branch. This allows faster 
      branching of remote branches. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

    * New tree format based on weave files, called version 5.
      Existing branches can be upgraded to this format using 
      'bzr upgrade'.

    * Symlinks are now versionable. Initial patch by 
      Erik Toubro Nielsen, updated to head by Robert Collins.

    * Executable bits are tracked on files. Patch from Gustavo
      Niemeyer.

    * 'bzr status' now shows unknown files inside a selected directory.
      Patch from Heikki Paajanen.

    * Merge conflicts are recorded in .bzr. Two new commands 'conflicts'
      and 'resolve' have needed added, which list and remove those 
      merge conflicts respectively. A conflicted tree cannot be committed
      in. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

    * 'rm' is now an alias for 'remove'.

    * Stores now split out their content in a single byte prefixed hash,
      dropping the density of files per directory by 256. Contributed by
      Gustavo Niemeyer.

    * 'bzr diff -r branch:URL' will now perform a diff between two branches.
      Contributed by Robert Collins.

    * 'bzr log' with the default formatter will show merged revisions,
      indented to the right. Initial implementation contributed by Gustavo
      Niemeyer, made incremental by Robert Collins.


  INTERNALS:

    * Test case failures have the exception printed after the log 
      for your viewing pleasure.

    * InventoryEntry is now an abstract base class, use one of the
      concrete InventoryDirectory etc classes instead.

    * Branch raises an UnsupportedFormatError when it detects a 
      bzr branch it cannot understand. This allows for precise
      handling of such circumstances.


  TESTING:

    * Removed testsweet module so that tests can be run after 
      bzr installed by 'bzr selftest'.

    * 'bzr selftest' command-line arguments can now be partial ids
      of tests to run, e.g. 'bzr selftest test_weave'

      
bzr 0.0.9 2005-09-23

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed "branch -r" option.

    * Fix remote access to branches containing non-compressed history.
      (Robert Collins).

    * Better reliability of http server tests.  (John Arbash-Meinel)

    * Merge graph maximum distance calculation fix.  (Aaron Bentley)
   
    * Various minor bug in windows support have been fixed, largely in the
      test suite. Contributed by Alexander Belchenko.

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Status now accepts a -r argument to give status between chosen
      revisions. Contributed by Heikki Paajanen.

    * Revision arguments no longer use +/-/= to control ranges, instead
      there is a 'before' namespace, which limits the successive namespace.
      For example '$ bzr log -r date:yesterday..before:date:today' will
      select everything from yesterday and before today. Contributed by
      Robey Pointer

    * There is now a bzr.bat file created by distutils when building on 
      Windows. Contributed by Alexander Belchenko.

  INTERNALS:

    * Removed uuid() as it was unused.

    * Improved 'fetch' code for pulling revisions from one branch into
      another (used by pull, merged, etc.)


bzr 0.0.8 2005-09-20

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Adding a file whose parent directory is not versioned will
      implicitly add the parent, and so on up to the root. This means
      you should never need to explictly add a directory, they'll just
      get added when you add a file in the directory.  Contributed by
      Michael Ellerman.

    * Ignore .DS_Store (contains Mac metadata) by default.  Patch from
      Nir Soffer.

    * If you set BZR_EDITOR in the environment, it is checked in
      preference to EDITOR and the config file for the interactive commit
      editing program. Related to this is a bugfix where a missing program
      set in EDITOR would cause editing to fail, now the fallback program
      for the operating system is still tried.

    * Files that are not directories/symlinks/regular files will no longer
      cause bzr to fail, it will just ignore them by default. You cannot add
      them to the tree though - they are not versionable.


  INTERNALS:

    * Refactor xml packing/unpacking.

  BUG FIXES: 

    * Fixed 'bzr mv' by Ollie Rutherfurd.

    * Fixed strange error when trying to access a nonexistent http
      branch.

    * Make sure that the hashcache gets written out if it can't be
      read.


  PORTABILITY:

    * Various Windows fixes from Ollie Rutherfurd.

    * Quieten warnings about locking; patch from Matt Lavin.


bzr-0.0.7 2005-09-02

  NEW FEATURES:

    * ``bzr shell-complete`` command contributed by Clint Adams to
      help with intelligent shell completion.

    * New expert command ``bzr find-merge-base`` for debugging merges.


  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Much better merge support.

    * merge3 conflicts are now reported with markers like '<<<<<<<'
      (seven characters) which is the same as CVS and pleases things
      like emacs smerge.


  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzr upgrade`` no longer fails when trying to fix trees that
      mention revisions that are not present.

    * Fixed bugs in listing plugins from ``bzr plugins``.

    * Fix case of $EDITOR containing options for the editor.

    * Fix log -r refusing to show the last revision.
      (Patch from Goffredo Baroncelli.)


  CHANGES:

    * ``bzr log --show-ids`` shows the revision ids of all parents.

    * Externally provided commands on your $BZRPATH no longer need
      to recognize --bzr-usage to work properly, and can just handle
      --help themselves.


  LIBRARY:

    * Changed trace messages to go through the standard logging
      framework, so that they can more easily be redirected by
      libraries.



bzr-0.0.6 2005-08-18

  NEW FEATURES:

    * Python plugins, automatically loaded from the directories on
      BZR_PLUGIN_PATH or ~/.bzr.conf/plugins by default.

    * New 'bzr mkdir' command.

    * Commit mesage is fetched from an editor if not given on the
      command line; patch from Torsten Marek.

    * ``bzr log -m FOO`` displays commits whose message matches regexp 
      FOO.
      
    * ``bzr add`` with no arguments adds everything under the current directory.

    * ``bzr mv`` does move or rename depending on its arguments, like
      the Unix command.

    * ``bzr missing`` command shows a summary of the differences
      between two trees.  (Merged from John Arbash-Meinel.)

    * An email address for commits to a particular tree can be
      specified by putting it into .bzr/email within a branch.  (Based
      on a patch from Heikki Paajanen.)


  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Faster working tree operations.


  CHANGES:

    * 3rd-party modules shipped with bzr are copied within the bzrlib
      python package, so that they can be installed by the setup
      script without clashing with anything already existing on the
      system.  (Contributed by Gustavo Niemeyer.)

    * Moved plugins directory to bzrlib/, so that there's a standard
      plugin directory which is not only installed with bzr itself but
      is also available when using bzr from the development tree.
      BZR_PLUGIN_PATH and DEFAULT_PLUGIN_PATH are then added to the
      standard plugins directory.

    * When exporting to a tarball with ``bzr export --format tgz``, put 
      everything under a top directory rather than dumping it into the
      current directory.   This can be overridden with the ``--root`` 
      option.  Patch from William Dodé and John Meinel.

    * New ``bzr upgrade`` command to upgrade the format of a branch,
      replacing ``bzr check --update``.

    * Files within store directories are no longer marked readonly on
      disk.

    * Changed ``bzr log`` output to a more compact form suggested by
      John A Meinel.  Old format is available with the ``--long`` or
      ``-l`` option, patched by William Dodé.

    * By default the commit command refuses to record a revision with
      no changes unless the ``--unchanged`` option is given.

    * The ``--no-plugins``, ``--profile`` and ``--builtin`` command
      line options must come before the command name because they 
      affect what commands are available; all other options must come 
      after the command name because their interpretation depends on
      it.

    * ``branch`` and ``clone`` added as aliases for ``branch``.

    * Default log format is back to the long format; the compact one
      is available with ``--short``.
      
      
  BUG FIXES:
  
    * Fix bugs in committing only selected files or within a subdirectory.


bzr-0.0.5  2005-06-15
  
  CHANGES:

    * ``bzr`` with no command now shows help rather than giving an
      error.  Suggested by Michael Ellerman.

    * ``bzr status`` output format changed, because svn-style output
      doesn't really match the model of bzr.  Now files are grouped by
      status and can be shown with their IDs.  ``bzr status --all``
      shows all versioned files and unknown files but not ignored files.

    * ``bzr log`` runs from most-recent to least-recent, the reverse
      of the previous order.  The previous behaviour can be obtained
      with the ``--forward`` option.
        
    * ``bzr inventory`` by default shows only filenames, and also ids
      if ``--show-ids`` is given, in which case the id is the second
      field.


  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * New 'bzr whoami --email' option shows only the email component
      of the user identification, from Jo Vermeulen.

    * New ``bzr ignore PATTERN`` command.

    * Nicer error message for broken pipe, interrupt and similar
      conditions that don't indicate an internal error.

    * Add ``.*.sw[nop] .git .*.tmp *,v`` to default ignore patterns.

    * Per-branch locks keyed on ``.bzr/branch-lock``, available in
      either read or write mode.

    * New option ``bzr log --show-ids`` shows revision and file ids.

    * New usage ``bzr log FILENAME`` shows only revisions that
      affected that file.

    * Changed format for describing changes in ``bzr log -v``.

    * New option ``bzr commit --file`` to take a message from a file,
      suggested by LarstiQ.

    * New syntax ``bzr status [FILE...]`` contributed by Bartosz
      Oler.  File may be in a branch other than the working directory.

    * ``bzr log`` and ``bzr root`` can be given an http URL instead of
      a filename.

    * Commands can now be defined by external programs or scripts
      in a directory on $BZRPATH.

    * New "stat cache" avoids reading the contents of files if they 
      haven't changed since the previous time.

    * If the Python interpreter is too old, try to find a better one
      or give an error.  Based on a patch from Fredrik Lundh.

    * New optional parameter ``bzr info [BRANCH]``.

    * New form ``bzr commit SELECTED`` to commit only selected files.

    * New form ``bzr log -r FROM:TO`` shows changes in selected
      range; contributed by John A Meinel.

    * New option ``bzr diff --diff-options 'OPTS'`` allows passing
      options through to an external GNU diff.

    * New option ``bzr add --no-recurse`` to add a directory but not
      their contents.

    * ``bzr --version`` now shows more information if bzr is being run
      from a branch.

  
  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed diff format so that added and removed files will be
      handled properly by patch.  Fix from Lalo Martins.

    * Various fixes for files whose names contain spaces or other
      metacharacters.


  TESTING:

    * Converted black-box test suites from Bourne shell into Python;
      now run using ``./testbzr``.  Various structural improvements to
      the tests.

    * testbzr by default runs the version of bzr found in the same
      directory as the tests, or the one given as the first parameter.

    * testbzr also runs the internal tests, so the only command
      required to check is just ``./testbzr``.

    * testbzr requires python2.4, but can be used to test bzr running
      under a different version.

    * Tests added for many other changes in this release.


  INTERNAL:

    * Included ElementTree library upgraded to 1.2.6 by Fredrik Lundh.

    * Refactor command functions into Command objects based on HCT by
      Scott James Remnant.

    * Better help messages for many commands.

    * Expose bzrlib.open_tracefile() to start the tracefile; until
      this is called trace messages are just discarded.

    * New internal function find_touching_revisions() and hidden
      command touching-revisions trace the changes to a given file.

    * Simpler and faster compare_inventories() function.

    * bzrlib.open_tracefile() takes a tracefilename parameter.

    * New AtomicFile class.

    * New developer commands ``added``, ``modified``.


  PORTABILITY:

    * Cope on Windows on python2.3 by using the weaker random seed.
      2.4 is now only recommended.


bzr-0.0.4  2005-04-22

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * 'bzr diff' optionally takes a list of files to diff.  Still a bit
      basic.  Patch from QuantumG.

    * More default ignore patterns.

    * New 'bzr log --verbose' shows a list of files changed in the
      changeset.  Patch from Sebastian Cote.

    * Roll over ~/.bzr.log if it gets too large.

    * Command abbreviations 'ci', 'st', 'stat', '?' based on a patch
      by Jason Diamon.

    * New 'bzr help commands' based on a patch from Denys Duchier.


  CHANGES:

    * User email is determined by looking at $BZREMAIL or ~/.bzr.email
      or $EMAIL.  All are decoded by the locale preferred encoding.
      If none of these are present user@hostname is used.  The host's
      fully-qualified name is not used because that tends to fail when
      there are DNS problems.

    * New 'bzr whoami' command instead of username user-email.


  BUG FIXES: 

    * Make commit safe for hardlinked bzr trees.

    * Some Unicode/locale fixes.

    * Partial workaround for difflib.unified_diff not handling
      trailing newlines properly.


  INTERNAL:

    * Allow docstrings for help to be in PEP0257 format.  Patch from
      Matt Brubeck.

    * More tests in test.sh.

    * Write profile data to a temporary file not into working
      directory and delete it when done.

    * Smaller .bzr.log with process ids.


  PORTABILITY:

    * Fix opening of ~/.bzr.log on Windows.  Patch from Andrew
      Bennetts.

    * Some improvements in handling paths on Windows, based on a patch
      from QuantumG.


bzr-0.0.3  2005-04-06

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * New "directories" internal command lists versioned directories
      in the tree.

    * Can now say "bzr commit --help".

    * New "rename" command to rename one file to a different name
      and/or directory.

    * New "move" command to move one or more files into a different
      directory.

    * New "renames" command lists files renamed since base revision.

    * New cat command contributed by janmar.

  CHANGES:

    * .bzr.log is placed in $HOME (not pwd) and is always written in
      UTF-8.  (Probably not a completely good long-term solution, but
      will do for now.)

  PORTABILITY:

    * Workaround for difflib bug in Python 2.3 that causes an
      exception when comparing empty files.  Reported by Erik Toubro
      Nielsen.

  INTERNAL:

    * Refactored inventory storage to insert a root entry at the top.

  TESTING:

    * Start of shell-based black-box testing in test.sh.


bzr-0.0.2.1

  PORTABILITY:

    * Win32 fixes from Steve Brown.


bzr-0.0.2  "black cube"  2005-03-31

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Default ignore list extended (see bzrlib/__init__.py).

    * Patterns in .bzrignore are now added to the default ignore list,
      rather than replacing it.

    * Ignore list isn't reread for every file.

    * More help topics.

    * Reinstate the 'bzr check' command to check invariants of the
      branch.

    * New 'ignored' command lists which files are ignored and why;
      'deleted' lists files deleted in the current working tree.

    * Performance improvements.

    * New global --profile option.
    
    * Ignore patterns like './config.h' now correctly match files in
      the root directory only.


bzr-0.0.1  2005-03-26

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * More information from info command.

    * Can now say "bzr help COMMAND" for more detailed help.

    * Less file flushing and faster performance when writing logs and
      committing to stores.

    * More useful verbose output from some commands.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix inverted display of 'R' and 'M' during 'commit -v'.

  PORTABILITY:

    * Include a subset of ElementTree-1.2.20040618 to make
      installation easier.

    * Fix time.localtime call to work with Python 2.3 (the minimum
      supported).


bzr-0.0.0.69  2005-03-22

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * First public release.

    * Storage of local versions: init, add, remove, rm, info, log,
      diff, status, etc.
