bzr install instructions
************************

Dependencies
------------

bzr requires Python2.4 and cElementTree:

If you wish to access branches over sftp, you will need paramiko and
pycrypto:

bzr can optionally use compiled versions of some parts of the code
for increased speed. When installing bzr you should have the python-dev
headers installed that are required for compiling extension modules.

If you are installing bzr from a bzr branch rather than a release tarball,
then you should also have the Pyrex package installed. This is not necessary
for release tarballs as they already contain the C files that Pyrex is needed
to create.

Installation
------------

When upgrading using setup.py, it is recommended that you first delete the
bzrlib directory from the install target.

To install bzr as a user, run

  python setup.py install --home ~ 

To install system-wide, run (as root)

  python setup.py install
