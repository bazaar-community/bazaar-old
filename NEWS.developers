changes in weave branch:

 * Remove RevisionReference class; Revision.parent_ids is now simply a
   list of their ids and parent_sha1s is a list of their corresponding
   sha1s (for old branches only at the moment.)

 * New method-object style interface for Commit() and Fetch().

 * Renamed Branch.last_patch() to Branch.last_revision(), since
   we call them revisions not patches.
