Configuring Bazaar
==================

A configuration option has:

- a name: a valid python identifier (even if it's not used as an
  identifier in python itself)

- a value: a unicode string

Sections
--------

Options are grouped into sections which share some properties with the well
known dict objects:

- the key is the name,
- you can get, set and remove an option,
- the value is a unicode string.

MutableSection is needed to set or remove an option, ReadOnlySection should
be used otherwise.
