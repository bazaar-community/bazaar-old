Revision Properties
===================

Bazaar repositories support setting of a key/value pairs for each revision.
Applications can use these properties to store additional information
about the revision.

Usage
-----

In general, revision properties are set by passing keyword argument
``revprops`` to method ``MutableTree.commit``. For example::

 properties = {}
 properties['my-property'] = 'test'
 tree.commit(message, revprops=properties)

Properties can be retrieved via the attribute ``properties`` of
instances of the class ``Revision``::

 if 'my-property' in revision.properties:
     my_property = revision.properties['my-property']
     ...

Well-known properties
---------------------

At the moment, three standardized revision properties are recognized and used
by bzrlib:

 * ``author`` - Author of the change, the value is in the same format as
   the committer-id. This property can be set by passing keyword argument
   ``author`` to function ``MutableTree.commit``.
 * ``branch-nick`` - Nick of the branch. It's either the directory name
   or manually set by ``bzr nick``. The value is set automatically in
   ``MutableTree.commit``.
 * ``bugs`` - A list of bug URLs and their statuses. The list is separated
   by the new-line character (\n) and each entry is in format
   '<URL> <status>'. Currently bzrlib uses only status 'fixed'. See
   `Bug Trackers`_ for more details about using this feature.
