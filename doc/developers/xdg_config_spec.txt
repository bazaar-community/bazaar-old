Transitioning Unix installs to the XDG Base Directory Specification
===================================================================

Currently, Bazaar stores its configuration files and plugins under the
directory ~/.bazaar on unix installs.  On Windows, this is
%APPDATA%/Bazaar/2.0 and on Mac OS X, the directory is ~/.bazaaar.  With the
XDG Base Directory specification
(http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html), many
Linux and Unix platforms have tried to centralize configuration files under a
specific directory referred to as $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.  This has a default value
of ~/.config.

Bazaar would like to be a good Unix citizen by using these standard locations
for configuration files.  This will require a transitional phase while moving
to the standard location.  Note that the following descriptions do not apply
to Windows or Mac OS X which can and should use their own native configuration
locations.

Transitional Phase
------------------

* If ~/.bazaar exists and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bazaar does not:

  - On opening config files, write out a message that users should move
    their config files to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bazaar and give them a command line
    to do so. Do NOT create new config files in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bazaar to
    avoid fragmentation (two configuration directories in use at the same
    time).

* If both ~/.bazaar and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bazaar exist:

  - Use the config files in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bazaar with a warning that those
    in ~/.bazaar are being ignored.  Don't use a pastiche of files from both
    directories, again to avoid fragmentation.

* If only $XDG_CONFIG_HOME exists, use it.


Final Phase
-----------

* If ~/.bazaar exists and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bazaar does not:

  - Explain that configuration files are now meant to be found in
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bazaar and offer to copy the existing files over.

* If both ~/.bazaar and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bazaar exist:

  - Warn that the configuration files in .bazaar are being ignored?
