Setting Up A Windows Build Host
===============================

This document describes the steps taken to set up a Windows build host. It is
intended to be step-by-step instructions of what packages need to be installed,
where they can be gotten from, and how they are configured.


Baseline
========

This was written as a step-by-step as I set up the Amazon EC2 'desolation'
instance. This was based on an Amazon Windows 2003 instance that already had
Visual Studio 2008 installed. Also note that for Amazon EC2, all programs were
installed into the "C:" drive, as the "D:" drive is essentially ``/tmp`` and is
not preserved between launched instances.


Install Packages
================

1) Download cygwin's setup.exe from http://www.cygwin.com
   At present the current version is 1.5.25-15. This is used primarily to
   install the build scripts and gcc-mingw. Note that we explicitly *don't*
   install cygwin's python or bzr package. As we are only interested in
   running the native version of bzr. For information on running the cygwin
   port of bzr, look elsewhere.

   Probably not all of these packages are necessary, but they make life easier.

   a) gcc-mingw32
   b) make
   c) openssh
   d) rsync
   e) vim
   f) wget
   g) zip
   h) unzip


2) Download the supported versions of python from http://www.python.org

   a) python 2.6.4
   b) python 2.5.4 http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.4/python-2.5.4.msi
   c) python 2.4.4 (there is no Windows installer for 2.4.5 or 2.4.6)
      http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.4/python-2.4.4.msi

   Note that for Amazon EC2, all of these were installed int

3) Configure 'distutils' for the compiler that you will be using. For python
   2.5 we use gcc-mingw32, for 2.6 we use Visual Studio 2008.
   
   Edit ``D:\Python25\Lib\disutils\distutils.cfg`` (you have to create the
   file). You want to add a section like::

     [build]
     compiler = mingw32

   This also requires 'fixing' the cygwin gcc installation so that distutils
   can find it. Specifically, it knows to look for ``gcc.exe`` however, the
   latest versions of cygwin start using "alternatives" and making ``gcc`` just
   a symlink.
   
   You also need to add ``C:\cygwin\bin`` and ``C:\cygwin\lib`` into your
   environment path. This is generally done with::

        Right Click My Computer / Properties / Advanced / Environment Variables
        System Variables / Select 'PATH' / Edit

4) Download important python libraries. At the moment, the official Windows
   all-in-one installer is built using python 2.5. We will likely soon switch
   to python 2.6.

   a) http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

      Installing this first should make it easier to install some of the other
      tools. To install something using easy install, it is generally best to
      open up a ``cmd.exe`` shell (*not* a cygwin shell) and do::

        cd C:\Python25
        python.exe Scripts\easy_install-script.py PACKAGE

   b) pywin32 http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/
   c) easy_install paramiko
      This will also bring in PyCrypto and compile it, so it is important to
      have configured step (3) correctly.
   d) easy_install Pyrex    (or Cython)
   e) easy_install cogapp
   f) install py2exe (easy_install failed)
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/
   g) easy_install docutils
   h) Install PyQt
      http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

      Currently they only seem to offer PyQt 4.4.3 for python 2.5 and PyQt
      4.6.1 for python 2.6. They generally don't make it easy to install old
      versions of PyQt.
   i) Install pyreadline
      https://launchpad.net/pyreadline/+download

5) Get Pageant, not strictly necessary, but it is a pretty good ssh-agent for
   Windows, and paramiko knows how to use keys from Pageant.

   http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

   Note that you probably want to set the environment variable
   ``BZR_SSH=paramiko`` at this time. Otherwise it will try to use the
   ``ssh.exe`` that it finds on your PATH (as configured in step 3), and
   cygwin's openssh does *not* know how to access Pageant.

   I usually get the 'all-in-one' installer, but only because it is easier. You
   only really need ``pageant.exe`` and possibly ``puttygen.exe``.
   
   If you do this, you'll probably also want to install a shortcut to
   ``pageant.exe`` in Start / Programs / Startup so that it always starts when
   you log in (though you still have to manually add your ssh keys.)

   Note that on the Amazon EC2 machine, I'm having problems with temp files
   being created without the permission for the current user to actually read
   them. They seem to be owned by ``Administrator`` rather than by
   ``Administrators``.
   
6) Install bzr. Usually it is easiest to just get the latest all-in-one
   installer from https://launchpad.net/bzr/+download

7) Install INNOSetup from:
   http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php

.. 
   vim: ft=rst tw=79 et
