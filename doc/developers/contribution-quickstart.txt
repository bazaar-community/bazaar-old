Bazaar Contribution in Five Minutes
===================================

Contributing to Bazaar requires attention to quality.  To ensure
high-quality commits, the "Bazaar process" involves you in our
code review and improvement activities.

In brief, a contribution should include:

1.  A brief rationale, including expected audience and use cases,
    for inclusion in Bazaar.

2.  A branch registered as a branch on LaunchPad, and submitted as
    a merge proposal.

3.  The branch should include:

    a.  implementation of the feature,

    b.  user documentation (if the feature is visible in the user
        interface) and/or developer documentation (if new or
        changed APIs are provided), and

    c.  tests to ensure the specification is correctly
        implemented.

For more information, see the :doc:`HACKING`.

If you are not an experienced Bazaar contributor, why not ask for
mentoring?  When you submit your merge proposal on Launchpad, simply say
"I'd like to be mentored, please" in your submission.  Or ask for help
with your contribution on the IRC channel, mailing list, or on Launchpad
(https://answers.launchpad.net/bzr).

Bazaar Mentors FAQ
==================

1.  Why is this "Bazaar process" in HACKING.txt so complicated?

    Answer: If we knew *that*, we'd simplify it!  We are working
    on streamlining many aspects, but quality comes first.

1.  What sort of things can a mentor help with?

    Anything that's getting in your way, time permitting.  This includes
    guiding you through the ``bzrlib`` API, explaining how to use our test
    infrastructure, discussing possible designs for your bug fix or
    feature, and so on.
