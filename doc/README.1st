These documents originally came from the Bazaar-NG wiki hosted at
http://bazaar-vcs.org. These documents, though maintained, can fall behind
when Bazaar-NG is under heavy development.

The documents on the wiki take precedence in the event of a discrepancy
between what is documented here and what is documented on the wiki.
