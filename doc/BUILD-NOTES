To build Bazaar's documentation using Sphinx, follow the
steps below.

0. Install Sphinx. You'll need Sphinx 0.6 or later. If that
   version isn't available in your package manager repositories
   yet, install python-easyinstall and use it to install Sphinx.
   See http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ for details.

1. Build the Bazaar docs normally, i.e. in the project root, run:

   make docs

2. Tweak the User Guide index page used:

   cd doc/en/user-guide
   bzr mv index.txt index-for-1x.txt
   bzr mv index-for-2x.txt index.txt

3. Tweak the Release Notes TOC depth:

   cd ../release-notes
   vi NEWS.txt  (change depth to 2)

4. Change to the docs directory and build the site:

   cd ../..
   make html

The generated output site can be found in _build/html.

Note: All of the above will Just Work soon. For now, we don't
want to break the existing doc generation until a few issues
with the Sphinx-generated site are ironed out, e.g. links from
the User Reference to ../user-guide/index.html#foo no longer
work when the User Guide is nicely split into topic pages.
