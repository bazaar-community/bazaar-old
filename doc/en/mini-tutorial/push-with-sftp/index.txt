Let's assume you want to publish your branch at myserver.com/myproject
and you have sftp access to the server::

  $ bzr push sftp://me@myserver.com/~/public_html/myproject/
  2 revision(s) pushed.
    
*Note:* to use sftp, you may need to install ``paramiko`` and
``pyCrypto``. See http://bazaar-vcs.org/InstallationFaq for details.

Now anyone can get their own copy of your branch by typing::

  bzr branch http://myserver.com/myproject/
