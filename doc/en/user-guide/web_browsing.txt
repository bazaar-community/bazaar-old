Web browsing
============

Overview
--------

There are a range of options available for providing a web view of a
Bazaar repository. In increasing order of complexity, these are:

* bzrweb
* webserve
* Loggerhead

The first 2 tools are lightweight and easy to install.
Loggerhead takes more effort to setup but provides more functionality.
See http://bazaar-vcs.org/WebInterface for the latest information on
these packages including download links.

Note: If your project is hosted or mirrored on Launchpad,
Loggerhead code browsing is provided as part of the service.
