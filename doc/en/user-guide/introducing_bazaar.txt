Introducing Bazaar
==================

What is Bazaar?
---------------

Bazaar is a tool for helping people collaborate. It does this by
tracking how a group of files evolves and using that information to help
people merge their changes together as safely as possible.

In general, tools that do this are known as revision control systems or
version control systems (VCS). In the past, VCS tools have been popular
with software developers. In the future, VCS tools will undoubtedly also be
important for other groups of people looking to work together on
files and documents, e.g. technical writers and translators.

A brief history of version control systems
------------------------------------------

VCS tools have been evolving for several decades now. In simple terms,
there have been 5 generations of tools:

 1. file versioning tools, e.g. SCCS, VCS
 2. tree versioning tools - central style, e.g. CVS
 3. tree versioning tools - central style, done right, e.g. Subversion
 4. tree versioning tools - distributed style, e.g. Arch
 5. tree versioning tools - distributed style, done right, e.g. Bazaar.

The design and implementation of Bazaar builds on the lessons learned
from all the previous generations of tools. In particular, Bazaar
cleanly supports both the central and the distributed version
control models so you can change models as it makes sense, without
needing to change tools.

Central vs distributed VCS
--------------------------

Many traditional VCS tools require a central server which provides the
change history or *repository* for a tree of files. To work on the files,
users need to connect to the server and *checkout* the files. This gives
them a directory or *working tree* in which a person can make changes.
To record or *commit* these changes, the user needs access to the central
server and they need to unsure they have merged their work with the latest
version stored before trying to commit. This approach is known as the
centralized model. 

The centralized model has proven useful over time but it can have some notable
drawbacks. Firstly, a centralized VCS requires that one is able to connect
to the server whenever one wants to do version control work. Secondly, the
centralized model tightly links the act of **snapshotting** changes with the act
of **publishing** those changes. This can be good in some circumstances but
it has a negative influence on quality in others.

Distributed VCS tools let users and teams have multiple repositories
rather than just a single central one. In Bazaar's case, the history is
normally kept in the same place as the code that is being version controlled.
This allows the user to commit their changes whenever it makes sense, even
when offline. Network access is only required when publishing changes or
when accessing changes in another location.

In fact, using distributed VCS tools wisely can have advantages well
beyond the obvious one of disconnected operations for developers.
Other advantages include:

 * easier for developers to create experimental branches
 * easier ad-hoc collaboration with peers
 * less time required on mechanical tasks - more time for creativity

 * increased release management flexibility through the use of
   "feature-wide" commits

 * trunk quality and stability can be kept higher, making everyone's
   job less stressful

 * in open source communities:

   * easier for non-core developers to create and maintain changes

   * easier for core developers to work with non-core developers and
     move them into the core

 * in companies, easier to work with distributed and outsourced teams.

centralized VCS tools, see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrWhy.


Key features of Bazaar
----------------------

While Bazaar is not the only distributed VCS tool around, it does have some
notable features that make it an excellent choice for many teams and
communities. These include:

 * it **Just Works** - a high focus on usability and performance
 * **adaptive** - cleanly supports many different ways of working together
 * **rich metadata** that tracks merge history across distributed locations,
   understands directories as first-class objects and correctly tracks
   renames of both files and directories
 * **integrated merging** that uses this metadata intelligently to
   ensure that merging is safe without being painful, letting you
   collaborate without fear
 * **truly portable** across many operating systems including Windows
 * **safe with your data** - integrity is checked using cryptographic
   techniques and all changes can be digitally signed if required
 * **low administration**, e.g. access to FTP or SFTP is enough to
   share with others - no special server required
 * **efficiently stores data** across branches in a flexible and safe way
 * an **open architecture and API** that makes it easy to integrate
   with other tools
 * a **large number of plugins** including bzr-svn and GUI front-ends
 * **excellent integration** with a range of companion tools and services
   including PQM, Bundle Buggy and Launchpad
 * **completely open source**
 * **commercial training and support** available from Canonical,
   the company that sponsors Ubuntu.

While all of these are important, perhaps the greatest asset Bazaar has is
an active and growing open source community behind it. Bazaar is completely
free software written in Python so it is easy to contribute improvements.
Our collective goal is to build and support a distributed VCS tool that
developers love to use, a tool that helps them get their job done without
getting in their way. If you wish to get involved, please see

Learning more
-------------

This manual provides an easy to read introduction to Bazaar and how to use
it effectively.  It is recommended that all users read at least the rest of
this chapter as it:

 * explains the core concepts users need to know
 * introduces some popular ways of using Bazaar to collaborate.

Chapters 2-6 provide a closer look at how to use Bazaar to complete
various tasks. It is recommended that most users read these in first-to-last
order shortly after starting to use Bazaar. Chapters 7 and beyond provide
additional information including some recommended best practices.
This material can be read when required and in any order.

If you are already familar with other version control tools,
you may wish to get started quickly by reading the following documents:

 * `Bazaar in five minutes`_ - a mini-tutorial

 * `Bazaar Quick Start Guide`_ - a one page summary of commonly used commands.

The online help and `Bazaar User Reference`_ are also particularly useful as
they provide all the gory details on the commands and options available.

.. _Bazaar User Reference: ../user-reference/bzr_man.html

We hope you find this manual useful. If you have suggestions on how it
or the rest of Bazaar's documentation can be improved, please contact
us on the mailing list, bazaar@lists.canonical.com.
