Using Bazaar
============

User interfaces
---------------

There are numerous user interfaces available for Bazaar.
The core package provides a command line tool called **bzr** and
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are available as plug-ins.

Using bzr
---------

The syntax is::

  bzr [global-options] command [options and arguments]

Global options affect how Bazaar operates and can appear either
before or after ``command``. Command specific options must appear
after the command but may be given either before, during or after any
command-specific arguments.

Getting help
------------

Bazaar comes with a built-in on-line help system. To see the list of topics,
the command is::

  bzr help

To see the list of commands, the command is::

  bzr help commands

To get help on topic xxx or command xxx, the command is::

  bzr help xxx

If you wish to search the help or read it as a larger document, the
information is also available in the Bazaar User Reference.
