Welcome to best practices
=========================

We hope that earlier chapters have given you a solid
understanding of how Bazaar can assist you in being productive
on your own and working effectively with others.
If you are learning Bazaar for the first time, it might be
good to try the procedures covered already for a while,
coming back to this manual once you have mastered them.

This chapter covers miscellaneous topics to guide you in
further optimizing how you use Bazaar. Unless stated otherwise,
the topics are independent of each other and can therefore be
read in whichever order you wish.
