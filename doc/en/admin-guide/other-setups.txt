Other Setups
============

Dumb servers
------------

Bazaar can also serve branches over protocols that know nothing about Bazaar's
specific needs.  These are called "dumb servers" to distinguish them from
Bazaar's native protocol.  Currently HTTP, FTP, SFTP and HTTP+WebDAV can be
used to read branches remotely.  FTP, SFTP and HTTP+WebDAV can be used for
writing as well.  To use any of these protocols, it is just necessary to
provide access to the server's filesystem under ``/srv/bzr``.

For example, for Apache to provide read-only access to the branches
in ``/srv/bzr`` the configuration may look like this::

  Alias /code /srv/bzr
  <Directory /srv/bzr>
      Options Indexes
      # ...
  </Directory>

and users could use the URL ``http://server.example.com/code/projectx/trunk``
to refer to the trunk branch.

Note that SFTP access is often available whenever there is SSH access, but it
may be a good choice when Bazaar cannot be installed on the server to allow
``bzr+ssh://`` access.  Dumb servers are slower by their very nature than the
native protocol, but they can be a good choice in situations where the
software and protocols that can be used on the server or the network is
limited.

Smart server over HTTP(S)
-------------------------

Bazaar can use its native protocol with HTTP requests.  Since HTTP is a network
protocol that is available on many networks, this can be a good option where
SSH access is not possible.  Another benefit of this setup is that all of the
authentication and access control methods available to the HTTP server (basic,
LDAP, ActiveDirectory, etc.) are then available to control access to Bazaar
branches.  More information about setting up this type of access using Apache
and FastCGI or mod_python or WSGI is in the `smart server section of the User's
Guide <../user-guide/http_smart_server.html>`_.

Direct Smart Server Access
--------------------------

The built-in server that is used by ``bzr+ssh://`` access can also be used as
a persistent server on a dedicated port.  Bazaar's official port is 4155,
although the port used can be configured.  Further information on running the
Bazaar smart server from inetd, or directly from the shell is in the `User's
Guide <../user-guide/server.html#inetd>`_.  The dedicated Bazaar server does not
currently perform any authentication, so this server by default provides
read-only access.  It can be run with the ``--allow-writes`` option, but if
the user that the server is running as has write access to the branch
directories on the filesystem, then this will allow anyone with access to port
4155 on the server to make changes to the branches stored there.
