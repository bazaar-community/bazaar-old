bzr 2.4b1
#########

:2.4b1: NOT RELEASED YET

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

.. These may require users to change the way they use Bazaar.

New Features
************

.. New commands, options, etc that users may wish to try out.

* The ``lp:`` directory service now supports Launchpad's QA staging.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #667483)

* External merge tools can now be configured in bazaar.conf. See
  ``bzr help configuration`` for more information.  (Gordon Tyler, #489915)

Improvements
************

.. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance 
   or memory usage, or better results.

* ``bzr cat-revision`` no longer requires a working tree. (Jelmer Vernooij, #704405)

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where bzr would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

* ``bzr push --overwrite`` with an older revision specified will now correctly
  roll back the target branch. (Jelmer Vernooij, #386576)

* ``bzr lp-propose`` can now propose merges against packaging branches on
  Launchpad without requiring the target branch to be specified.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #704647)

* ``bzr lp-propose`` no longer requires a reviewer to be specified. It will
  instead leave setting the reviewer up to Launchpad if it was not specified.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #583772)

* ``bzr pull`` will now exit with exit code 1 if there were tag conflicts.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #213185)

* ``bzr serve`` no longer crashes when a server_started hook is installed and
  IPv6 support is available on the system. (Jelmer Vernooij, #293697)

* ``bzr whoami`` will now display an error if both a new identity and
  ``--email`` were specified. (Jelmer Vernooij, #680449)

* ``launchpadlib`` doesn't provide the ``uris`` module in some old versions.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #706835)

* Plugins incompatible with the current version of bzr no longer produce a
  warning on every command invocation.  Instead, a message is shown by
  ``bzr plugins`` and in crash reports.
  (#704195, Martin Pool)

Documentation
*************

.. Improved or updated documentation.

API Changes
***********

.. Changes that may require updates in plugins or other code that uses
   bzrlib.

* Added ``bzrlib.mergetools`` module with helper functions for working with
  the list of external merge tools. (Gordon Tyler, #489915)

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin 
   developers, but interesting for bzr developers.

Testing
*******

.. Fixes and changes that are only relevant to bzr's test framework and 
   suite.  This can include new facilities for writing tests, fixes to 
   spurious test failures and changes to the way things should be tested.
