bzr 2.5b1
#########

:2.5b1: NOT RELEASED YET

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

.. These may require users to change the way they use Bazaar.

New Features
************

.. New commands, options, etc that users may wish to try out.

* Accessing a packaging branch on Launchpad (eg, ``lp:ubuntu/bzr``) now
  checks to see if the most recent published source package version for
  that project is present in the branch tags. This should help developers
  trust whether the packaging branch is up-to-date and can be used for new
  changes. The level of verbosity is controlled by the config item
  ``launchpad.packaging_verbosity``. It can be set to one of

  off
    disable all checks


  minimal
    only display if the branch is out-of-date

  short
    also display single-line up-to-date and missing,


  all
    (default) display multi-line content for all states


  (John Arbash Meinel, #609187, #812928)

* Add a config option gpg_signature_key for setting which GPG key
  should be used to sign commits. Also default to using the gpg user
  identity which matches user_email() as set by whoami.

* bzr log -m now matches message, author, committer and bugs instead
  of just matching the message.  --message keeps its original meaning,
  while --match-message, --match-author, --match-committer and
  --match-bugs match each of those fields.

* Relative local paths can now be specified in URL syntax by using the
  "file:" prefix.  (Jelmer Vernooij)

Improvements
************

.. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance 
   or memory usage, or better results.

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where bzr would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

* A call to CHKInventory's filter-method will not result in a
  DuplicateFileId error, if you move a subfolder and change a file in
  that subfolder.
  (Bastian Bowe, #809901)

* Fix i18n use when no environment variables are set. (Jelmer Vernooij, #810701)

* TreeTransformBase.fixup_new_roots no longer forces trees to have a root, so
  operations that use it, like merge, can now create trees without a root.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Documentation
*************

.. Improved or updated documentation.

API Changes
***********

.. Changes that may require updates in plugins or other code that uses
   bzrlib.

* Remove ``AtomicFile.closed`` which has been deprecated in bzr 0.10.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Remove ``commands._builtin_commands``, ``commands.shlex_split_unicode``,
  ``Command._maybe_expand_globs`` and ``Command.run_direct`` deprecated in
  2.10 and 2.2.0. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Remove ``diff.get_trees_and_branches_to_diff`` deprecated in 2.2.0.

* Remove ``log.calculate_view_revisions``, ``log._filter_revision_range``,
  ``log.get_view_revisions`` which have been deprecated in bzr 2.1.0. Also
  remove ``log.show_one_log`` which was never properly deprecated but wasn't
  used and is easy to inline if needed. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Remove ``trace.info``, ``trace.error`` and ``trace.show_log_error``
  deprecated in 2.1.0. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Remove ``TransportListRegistry.set_default_transport``, as the concept of
  a default transport is currently unused. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* There is a new class `ContentFilterTree` that provides a facade for 
  content filtering.  The `filtered` parameter to `export` is deprecated 
  in favor of passing a filtered tree, and the specific exporter plugins
  no longer support it.
  (Martin Pool)

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin 
   developers, but interesting for bzr developers.

Testing
*******

.. Fixes and changes that are only relevant to bzr's test framework and 
   suite.  This can include new facilities for writing tests, fixes to 
   spurious test failures and changes to the way things should be tested.

* `BranchBuilder.build_snapshot` now supports a "flush" action.  This
  cleanly and reliably allows tests using `BranchBuilder` to construct
  branches that e.g. rename files out of a directory and unversion that
  directory in the same revision.  Previously some changes were impossible
  due to the order that `build_snapshot` performs its actions.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* `TestCaseWithMemoryTransport` is faster now: `_check_safety_net` now
  just compares the bytes in the dirstate file to its pristine state,
  rather than opening the WorkingTree and calling ``last_revision()``.
  This reduces the overall test suite time by about 10% on my laptop.
  (Andrew Bennetts)
