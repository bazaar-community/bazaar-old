Testing
*******

.. Fixes and changes that are only relevant to bzr's test framework and 
   suite.  This can include new facilities for writing tests, fixes to 
   spurious test failures and changes to the way things should be tested.

* `BranchBuilder.build_snapshot` now supports a "flush" action.  This
  cleanly and reliably allows tests using `BranchBuilder` to construct
  branches that e.g. rename files out of a directory and unversion that
  directory in the same revision.  Previously some changes were impossible
  due to the order that `build_snapshot` performs its actions.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* `TestCaseWithMemoryTransport` is faster now: `_check_safety_net` now
  just compares the bytes in the dirstate file to its pristine state,
  rather than opening the WorkingTree and calling ``last_revision()``.
  This reduces the overall test suite time by about 10% on my laptop.
  (Andrew Bennetts)
