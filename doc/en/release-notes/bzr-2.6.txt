bzr 2.6b1
#########

:2.6b1: NOT RELEASED YET

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

.. These may require users to change the way they use Bazaar.

New Features
************

.. New commands, options, etc that users may wish to try out.

Improvements
************

.. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance 
   or memory usage, or better results.

 * Access to HTTPS URLs now uses the urrllib implementation by default.
   For the old pycurl-based implementation, specify ``https+pycurl://`` as
   the URL scheme when accessing a HTTPS location.
   (Jelmer Vernooij, #125055)

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where bzr would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

Documentation
*************

.. Improved or updated documentation.

API Changes
***********

.. Changes that may require updates in plugins or other code that uses
   bzrlib.

* File ids in the ``Tree`` API can now be bytestring as previously,
  or tuples of bytestrings.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``mail_client`` now accepts a configuration stack object rather than
  an old style Config object. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New configuration option class ``RegistryOption`` which is backed
  onto a registry. (Jelmer Vernooij)

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin 
   developers, but interesting for bzr developers.

Testing
*******

.. Fixes and changes that are only relevant to bzr's test framework and 
   suite.  This can include new facilities for writing tests, fixes to 
   spurious test failures and changes to the way things should be tested.
