:2.6b1: NOT RELEASED YET

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

.. These may require users to change the way they use Bazaar.

New Features
************

.. New commands, options, etc that users may wish to try out.

Improvements
************

.. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance 
   or memory usage, or better results.

* Access to HTTPS URLs now uses the urrllib implementation by default.
  For the old pycurl-based implementation, specify ``https+pycurl://`` as
  the URL scheme when accessing a HTTPS location.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #125055)

* Add short option alias ``-N`` for ``--no-recurse``.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #945904)

* Avoid 'Invalid range access' errors when whole files are retrieved with
  transport.http.get() . (Vincent Ladeuil, #924746)

* ``bzr rmbranch`` now supports removing colocated branches.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #920653)

* ``bzr rmbranch`` no longer removes active branches unless ``--force``
  is specified. (Jelmer Vernooij, #922953)

* ``bzr verify-signatures`` now shows a progress bar.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Two new command hooks, ``pre_command`` and ``post_command``,
  provide notification before and after a command has been run.
  (Brian de Alwis, Jelmer Vernooij)

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where bzr would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

* Fix ``bzr config`` display for ``RegistryOption`` values.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #930182)

Documentation
*************

.. Improved or updated documentation.

API Changes
***********

.. Changes that may require updates in plugins or other code that uses
   bzrlib.

* ``GPGStrategy.do_verifications`` has been deprecated.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* File ids in the ``Tree`` API can now be bytestring as previously,
  or tuples of bytestrings.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``mail_client`` now accepts a configuration stack object rather than
  an old style Config object. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New method ``Repository.verify_revision_signatures``.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New configuration option class ``RegistryOption`` which is backed
  onto a registry. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New convenience API method ``WorkingTree.get_config_stack``.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Remove ``Merge3Merger.scalar_three_way`` deprecated in 2.2.0,
  ``hooks.known_hooks_key_to_parent_and_attribute`` deprecated in 2.3,
  ``hooks.Hooks.create_hook`` deprecated in 2.4,
  ``inventory.Inventory.__contains__`` deprecated in 2.4.0,
  ``workingtree.WorkingTreeFormat.get_default_format`` deprecated in 2.4.0,
  ``workingtree.WorkingTreeFormat.register_format`` deprecated in 2.4.0,
  ``workingtree.WorkingTreeFormat.register_extra_format`` deprecated in 2.4.0,
  ``workingtree.WorkingTreeFormat.unregister_extra_format`` deprecated in 2.4.0,
  ``workingtree.WorkingTreeFormat.get_formats`` deprecated in 2.4.0,
  ``workingtree.WorkingTreeFormat.set_default_format`` deprecated in 2.4.0,
  ``workingtree.WorkingTreeFormat.unregister_format`` deprecated in 2.4.0,
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin 
   developers, but interesting for bzr developers.

* ``Tree.path2id`` now once again accepts a list of path elements
  in addition to a path. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Turn config option expansion on by default. The only options for which
  this should be disabled are templates which should already have used
  conf.get(option, expand=False) or conf.get_user_option(option,
  expand=False). (Vincent Ladeuil)

Testing
*******

.. Fixes and changes that are only relevant to bzr's test framework and 
   suite.  This can include new facilities for writing tests, fixes to 
   spurious test failures and changes to the way things should be tested.
