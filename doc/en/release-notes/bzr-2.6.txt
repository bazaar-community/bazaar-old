bzr 2.6b1
#########

:2.6b1: 2012-03-15

This is the first beta for the 2.6 series, leading up to a 2.6.0 release in
August 2012.

This release includes ssl certificates verification from the urllib-based
http implementation turned on by default, fixes some UI issues around
colocated branches, documentation fixes and more.

This release includes all bugs fixed in previous series known at the time of
this release.

Beta releases are suitable for everyday use but may cause some
incompatibilities with plugins.  Some plugins may need small updates to work
with 2.6b1.

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

None.
