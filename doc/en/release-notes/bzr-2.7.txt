bzr 2.7b1
#########

:2.7b1: NOT RELEASED YET

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

.. These may require users to change the way they use Bazaar.

New Features
************

.. New commands, options, etc that users may wish to try out.

Improvements
************

.. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance 
   or memory usage, or better results.

* bzrlib.patches.parse_patches can optionally return a list of 'dirty'
  patch headers (prefixed with '===').
  (Kit Randel, #1400567)

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where bzr would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

* 'acceptable_keys' from 'bazaar.conf' is now properly handled.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #1249732)

* Option names are now checked to be valid [dotted] python identifiers. Also
  ignore invalid references (i.e. using invalid option names) while
  expanding option values. (Vincent Ladeuil, #1235099)

* Fix pyrex version checking to be more robust.
  (Andrew Starr-Bochicchio, #1030521 )

* Forbid more operations for ReadonlyTransportDecorator.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #150196)

Documentation
*************

.. Improved or updated documentation.

API Changes
***********

.. Changes that may require updates in plugins or other code that uses
   bzrlib.

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin 
   developers, but interesting for bzr developers.

Changed Behaviour
*****************

* Also honor $XDG_CONFIG_HOME specification on Mac OS X platform.
  (Fabien Meghazi)

Testing
*******

.. Fixes and changes that are only relevant to bzr's test framework and 
   suite.  This can include new facilities for writing tests, fixes to 
   spurious test failures and changes to the way things should be tested.

* Fix racy http tests (TestBadStatusServer is so simple, it exposes a race
  in python 2.7.9. This happens only when both the http server and client
  are run in the same process.). Only tests are affected.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #1451448)
     
* Fix warnings on stderr caused by the atexit handler triggering for the
  wrong reason: the 'config' command should explicitly save the changes when
  modifying or removing an option and not rely on the atexit
  handler. (Vincent Ladeuil, #1331999)

* Handle (minor) incompatible change in python 2.7.6 leading to test
  failures. Only tests are affected. (Vincent Ladeuil, #1303879)

* Take python 2.7.6 late (better than never) bugfix in ntpath.py into
  account. Only tests are affected (Vincent Ladeuil, #1303879).

* Remove wrong assumption about how TCP server and client interact when run
  inside the same process. (Vincent Ladeuil, #1269886).

* Restrict access to '.netrc' in tests or recent python (2.7.5-8) will
  complain. (Vincent Ladeuil, #1233413)

* Skip windows-only tests that start failing with python 2.7.9, there is no
  way to fix them without testing on windows itself.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #1451448)
