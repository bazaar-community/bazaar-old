#########

:2.7b1: NOT RELEASED YET

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

.. These may require users to change the way they use Bazaar.

New Features
************

.. New commands, options, etc that users may wish to try out.

Improvements
************

.. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance 
   or memory usage, or better results.

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where bzr would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

* 'acceptable_keys' from 'bazaar.conf' is now properly handled.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #1249732)

* Option names are now checked to be valid [dotted] python identifiers. Also
  ignore invalid references (i.e. using invalid option names) while
  expanding option values. (Vincent Ladeuil, #1235099)

Documentation
*************

.. Improved or updated documentation.

API Changes
***********

.. Changes that may require updates in plugins or other code that uses
   bzrlib.

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin 
   developers, but interesting for bzr developers.

Testing
*******

.. Fixes and changes that are only relevant to bzr's test framework and 
   suite.  This can include new facilities for writing tests, fixes to 
   spurious test failures and changes to the way things should be tested.

* Restrict access to '.netrc' in tests or recent python (2.7.5-8) will
  complain. (Vincent Ladeuil, #1233413)
