The hook signature is (push_result), containing the members
(source, local, master, old_revno, old_revid, new_revno, new_revid)
where local is the local target branch or None, master is the target 
master branch, and the rest should be self-explanatory. The source
is read-locked and the target branches are write-locked. Source will
be the local low-latency branch.


post_pull
#########
Run after ``pull`` has completed.

The hook signature is (push_result) containing the members
(source, local, master, old_revno, old_revid, new_revno, new_revid)
where local is the local target branch or None, master is the target 
master branch, and the rest should be self explanatory. The source
is read-locked and the target branches are write-locked. Source will
be the local low-latency branch.

pre_commit
##########
Run prefore ``commit`` has completed.

The hook signature is (local, master, old_revno, old_revid, future_revno,
future_revid, tree_delta, future_tree) where old_revno is NULL_REVISION for
the first commit to a branch, tree_delta is a TreeDelta object describing
changes from the basis revision, and future_tree is an in-memory tree
obtained from CommitBuilder.revision_tree(). Hooks MUST NOT modify tree_delta
and future_tree.

post_commit
###########
Run after ``commit`` has completed.

The hook signature is (local, master, old_revno, old_revid, new_revno,
new_revid) old_revid is NULL_REVISION for the first commit to a branch.

post_uncommit
#############
Run after ``uncommit`` has completed.

The api signature is (local, master, old_revno, old_revid, new_revno,
new_revid) where local is the local branch or None, master is the target
branch, and an empty branch receives new_revno of 0, new_revid of None.

set_rh
######
Run after the branch's revision history has been modified (push, pull, commit
and uncommit can all modify the revision history).

The hook signature is (branch, revision_history), and the branch will be
write-locked.
