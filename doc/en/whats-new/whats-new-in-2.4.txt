What's New in Bazaar 2.4?
*************************

Bazaar 2.4 is still under development, and will be released in August 2011.
This document accumulates a high level summary of what's changed.  See the
:doc:`../release-notes/index` for a full list.

Users are encouraged to upgrade from the other stable series.  This
document outlines the improvements in Bazaar 2.4 vs Bazaar 2.3. As well as
summarizing improvements made to the core product, it highlights
enhancements within the broader Bazaar world of potential interest to
those upgrading.

Bazaar 2.4.0 is fully compatible both locally and on the network with 2.0,
2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, and can read and write repositories generated by all
previous versions.

External Merge Tools
********************

External merge tool configuration has been added to ``bzr`` core. The name
and commandline of one or more external merge tools can be defined in
bazaar.conf. See the help topic ``configuration`` for more details.

Tagged Revisions are Copied
***************************

When tags are copied from a branch, the associated revisions are now copied
too.  Previously operations like branching, merging or pulling might have
copied new tags visible in ``bzr tags``, but not copied the revisions.  Now
revisions from tags will always be present, so that operations like ``bzr
log -r tag:foo`` will always work.

Configuration files
*******************

Option values can now refer to other options in the same configuration file by
enclosing them in curly brackets (``{option}``).`
