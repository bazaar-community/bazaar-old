What's New in Bazaar 2.5?
*************************

Bazaar 2.5 is still under development, and will be released in February 2012.
This document accumulates a high level summary of what's changed.  See the
:doc:`../release-notes/index` for a full list.

Users are encouraged to upgrade from the other stable series.  This
document outlines the improvements in Bazaar 2.5 vs Bazaar 2.4. As well as
summarizing improvements made to the core product, it highlights
enhancements within the broader Bazaar world of potential interest to
those upgrading.

Bazaar 2.5.0 is fully compatible both locally and on the network with 2.0,
2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4, and can read and write repositories generated by all
previous versions.

Overriding configuration options from the command line
******************************************************

The ``-O`` parameter available for all bzr commands allows a user to
override a configuration option from the command line. For example::

  bzr pull -v -Olog_format=line

will change the way the pulled revisions are displayed (the default log
format is ``long``). This a work in progress and only some options are
supported so far.

Working on a posix system without a locale
******************************************

Previously bzr needed a valid locale set to work with branches containing
non-ascii filenames. It will now use utf-8 rather than ascii as a fallback
encoding for interacting with the filesystem. This makes creating a working
tree and commiting to it possible for such branches in most environments.

SSL Certificate Verification Support in urllib HTTPS backend
************************************************************

In previous versions of Bazaar, only one of the two supported HTTPS
backends, pycurl, supported verification of SSL certificates. This version
also introduces this support for the urllib backend.

Along with this support two new options have been introduced to control
which CA's are trusted and to what degree server certificates should be
verified. See ``bzr help ssl.ca_certs`` and ``bzr help ssl.cert_reqs``
for more information

Users who have previously used the urllib HTTPS backend with servers
with invalid or untrusted certificates can continue to do so by
adding the required certificates to the trusted CA certificate file
(recommended) or by setting the ``ssl.cert_reqs`` option to ``none``.
