What's New in Bazaar 2.2?
=========================

This document outlines the major improvements in Bazaar 2.2
vs Bazaar 2.1. As well as summarizing improvements made to
the core product, it highlights enhancements within the broader
Bazaar world of potential interest to those upgrading.

.. warning::

   Bazaar 2.2.0 is currently in development. While less stable than
   Bazaar 2.1.x, we aim to keep quality at a high level:

   * Monthly beta releases should be suitable for early adopters of new
     features.

   * Nightly builds are suitable for users interested in assisting
     with testing.

   If it doubt, please use the latest 2.1 release instead.


Improved conflict handling
--------------------------

Tree-shape conflicts can be resolved by providing ``--take-this`` and
``--take-other`` to the ``bzr resolve`` command. Just marking the conflict
as resolved is still accessible via the ``--done`` default action.


Improved Launchpad integration
------------------------------

Merges can be proposed on Launchpad with the new **lp-propose-merge**
command.


Notable plugin enhancements
---------------------------

The grep plugin ...


Better documentation

Numerous improvements have been made to the developer documentation.


Enhanced GUI clients
