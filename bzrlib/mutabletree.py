    Generally speaking these mutations are only possible within a lock_write
    context, and will revert if the lock is broken abnormally - but this cannot
    be guaranteed - depending on the exact implementation of the mutable state.

    The most common form of Mutable Tree is WorkingTree, see bzrlib.workingtree.
    For tests we also have MemoryTree which is a MutableTree whose contents are
    entirely in memory.

    For now, we are not treating MutableTree as an interface to provide
    conformance tests for - rather we are testing MemoryTree specifically, and 
    interface testing implementations of WorkingTree.

    A mutable tree always has an associated Branch and BzrDir object - the
    branch and bzrdir attributes.
