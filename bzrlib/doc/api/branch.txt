The Branch API in bzrlib provides creation and management of Branches.

A Branch represents a series of commits and merges carried out by a user.

Branches are created at urls or file paths:

   >>> from tempfile import mkdtemp
   >>> from bzrlib.branch import Branch
   >>> branchdir = mkdtemp()
   >>> new_branch = Branch.create(branchdir)

A branch has a history of revisions on it:

   >>> new_branch.revision_history()
   []


We need to write some more documentation, showing
push and pull operations. Cloning might also be nice.
