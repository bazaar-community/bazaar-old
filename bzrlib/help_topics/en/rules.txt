Rules
=====

Introduction
------------

Rules are defined in ini file format where the sections are file glob
patterns and the contents of each section are the preferences for files
matching that pattern. For example::

    [*.bat]
    eol = dos

    [*.html]
    keywords = escape

Preferences like these are useful for commands and plugins wishing to
provide custom behaviour for selected files in selected branches.


Files
-----

Branch-specific rules are defined in ``.bzrrules`` in the root of the
working tree. Default rules for all branches are defined in
``BZR_HOME/rules``. Either or both files may be missing. If a rule is
matched by a pattern in the branch level file, searching stops.


Patterns
--------

Patterns are ordered and searching stops as soon as one matches.
As a consequence, more explicit patterns should be placed towards
the top of the file. Rule patterns use exactly the same conventions
as ignore patterns. See ``bzr help patterns`` for details.

Note: Patterns containing square brackets should be surrounded in
quotes to ensure they are corrected parsed.
