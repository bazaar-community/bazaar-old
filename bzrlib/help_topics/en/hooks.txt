Hooks
=====

post_push
---------

Run after ``push`` has completed.

The hook signature is (push_result), containing the members

  source_branch
    Where the data is being pushed from (read locked).
    This should be the lowest latency branch.

  target_branch
    The direct location where data is being sent (write locked).

  master_branch
    Either target_branch, or if the target is a bound branch, it
    will be the master location (write locked).

  local_branch
    If the target is a bound branch, this will be the target
    branch, else it will be None.

  old_revno
    The revision number (eg 10) of the branch before the push.

  old_revid
    The revision id (eg joe@foo.com-1234234-aoeua34) before the push.

  new_revno
    The revision number (eg 12) of the branch after the push.

  new_revid
    The revision id (eg joe@foo.com-5676566-boa234a) after the push.

post_pull
---------

Run after ``pull`` has completed.

The hook signature is (push_result) containing the members
(source, local, master, old_revno, old_revid, new_revno, new_revid)
where local is the local target branch or None, master is the target 
master branch, and the rest should be self explanatory. The source
is read-locked and the target branches are write-locked. Source will
be the local low-latency branch.

pre_commit
----------

Run prefore ``commit`` has completed.

The hook signature is (local, master, old_revno, old_revid, future_revno,
future_revid, tree_delta, future_tree) where old_revno is NULL_REVISION for
the first commit to a branch, tree_delta is a TreeDelta object describing
changes from the basis revision, and future_tree is an in-memory tree
obtained from CommitBuilder.revision_tree(). Hooks MUST NOT modify tree_delta
and future_tree.

post_commit
-----------

Run after ``commit`` has completed.

The hook signature is (local, master, old_revno, old_revid, new_revno,
new_revid) old_revid is NULL_REVISION for the first commit to a branch.

post_uncommit
-------------

Run after ``uncommit`` has completed.

The api signature is (local, master, old_revno, old_revid, new_revno,
new_revid) where local is the local branch or None, master is the target
branch, and an empty branch receives new_revno of 0, new_revid of None.

post_change_branch_tip
----------------------

Run after a branch tip has been changed but while the branch is still
write-locked. Note that push, pull, commit and uncommit all invoke this hook.

The hook signature is (params), where params is an object containing
the members

  branch
    The branch whose tip has been changed.

  old_revno
    The revision number (eg 10) of the branch before the change.

  old_revid
    The revision id (eg joe@foo.com-1234234-aoeua34) before the change.

  new_revno
    The revision number (eg 12) of the branch after the change.

  new_revid
    The revision id (eg joe@foo.com-5676566-boa234a) after the change.

The old_revno and new_revno members are integers, as the head
revision is never has a dotted revision number.

set_rh
------

Note: This hook is now deprecated and will be removed in the near future.
Please use the ``post_change_branch_tip`` hook instead.
