Location aliases
================

Bazaar defines several aliases for locations associated with a branch.  These
can be used with most commands that expect a location, such as `bzr push`.

The aliases are::

  :parent    the parent of this branch
  :submit    the submit branch for this branch
  :public    the public location of this branch
  :bound     the branch this branch is bound to, for bound branches
  :push      the saved location used for `bzr push` with no arguments
  :this      this branch

For example, to push to the parent location::

    bzr push :parent
