"""Store and retrieve weaves in files.

There is one format marker followed by a blank line, followed by a
series of version headers, followed by the weave itself.

Each version marker has

 'i'   parent version indexes
 '1'   SHA-1 of text
 'n'   name

The inclusions do not need to list versions included by a parent.

The weave is bracketed by 'w' and 'W' lines, and includes the '{}[]'
processing instructions.  Lines of text are prefixed by '.' if the
line contains a newline, or ',' if not.
