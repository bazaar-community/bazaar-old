    """Commit working copy as a new revision.

    The basic approach is to add all the file texts into the
    store, then the inventory, then make a new revision pointing
    to that inventory and store that.

    This is not quite safe if the working copy changes during the
    commit; for the moment that is simply not allowed.  A better
    approach is to make a temporary copy of the files before
    computing their hashes, and then add those hashes in turn to
    the inventory.  This should mean at least that there are no
    broken hash pointers.  There is no way we can get a snapshot
    of the whole directory at an instant.  This would also have to
    be robust against files disappearing, moving, etc.  So the
    whole thing is a bit hard.

    This raises PointlessCommit if there are no changes, no new merges,
    and allow_pointless  is false.

    timestamp -- if not None, seconds-since-epoch for a
         postdated/predated commit.

    specific_files
        If true, commit only those files.

    rev_id
        If set, use this as the new revision id.
        Useful for test or import commands that need to tightly
        control what revisions are assigned.  If you duplicate
        a revision id that exists elsewhere it is your own fault.
        If null (default), a time/random revision id is generated.
