A plugin for merging bzr's NEWS file.

Install as usual (e.g. symlink this directory into ~/.bazaar/plugins), and any
file with a path of NEWS that is in bzr's NEWS format will be merged with this
hook.

This hook can resolve conflicts where both sides add entries at the same place.
If it encounters a more difficult conflict it gives up and bzr will fallback to
the default merge algorithm.
