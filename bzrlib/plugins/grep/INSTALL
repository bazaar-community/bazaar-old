'bzr-grep' is a bazaar plugin so you need to install it
in your bazaar plugins directory.

    $ bzr branch lp:bzr-grep ~/.bazaar/plugins/grep

If you have it downloaded, simply move it into the plugins directory.

    $ mv bzr-grep ~/.bazaar/plugins/grep

You may have to create the 'plugins' directory first.
Also, note that the plugin should be placed as 'grep' and NOT
'bzr-grep' in the plugins directory.
