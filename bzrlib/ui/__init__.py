"""Abstraction for interacting with the user.

Applications can choose different types of UI, and they deal with displaying
messages or progress to the user, and with gathering different types of input.

Several levels are supported, and you can also register new factories such as
for a GUI.

bzrlib.ui.UIFactory
    Semi-abstract base class

bzrlib.ui.SilentUIFactory
    Produces no output and cannot take any input; useful for programs using
    bzrlib in batch mode or for programs such as loggerhead.

bzrlib.ui.CannedInputUIFactory
    For use in testing; the input values to be returned are provided 
    at construction.

bzrlib.ui.text.TextUIFactory
    Standard text command-line interface, with stdin, stdout, stderr.
    May make more or less advanced use of them, eg in drawing progress bars,
    depending on the detected capabilities of the terminal.
    GUIs may choose to subclass this so that unimplemented methods fall
    back to working through the terminal.
