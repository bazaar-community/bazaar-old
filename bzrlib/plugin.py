"""bzr python plugin support

Any python module in $BZR_PLUGIN_PATH will be imported upon initialization of
bzrlib. The module will be imported as 'bzrlib.plugins.$BASENAME(PLUGIN)'.
In the plugin's main body, it should update any bzrlib registries it wants to
extend; for example, to add new commands, import bzrlib.commands and add your
new command to the plugin_cmds variable.
"""

# TODO: Refactor this to make it more testable.  The main problem at the
# moment is that loading plugins affects the global process state -- for bzr
# in general use it's a reasonable assumption that all plugins are loaded at
# startup and then stay loaded, but this is less good for testing.
# 
# Several specific issues:
#  - plugins can't be unloaded and will continue to effect later tests
#  - load_plugins does nothing if called a second time
#  - plugin hooks can't be removed
#
# Our options are either to remove these restrictions, or work around them by
# loading the plugins into a different space than the one running the tests.
# That could be either a separate Python interpreter or perhaps a new
# namespace inside this interpreter.
