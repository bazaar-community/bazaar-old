# This file is for listing TODOs for branches that are being worked on.
# It should ALWAYS be empty in the mainline or in integration branches.

* add more tests for has and readv (_get_full wasn't addressed
   by jam's patch but _get_ranged should be reported twice currently).

* complete _ReportingFileSocket implementation for write
   operations ?

* triple check https activity reporting (including proxy
   connection)
