Caveats
-------



* Don't use this for critical data; at the very least keep separate
  regular snapshots of your tree.


Dependencies
------------

This is mostly developed on Linux (Ubuntu); it should work on Unix,
Windows, or OS X with relatively little trouble.

The only dependency is Python 2.4.

You may optionally install cElementTree to speed up some operations.
This is strongly recommended if you are dealing with large trees.

This package includes copies of two Python libraries, elementtree and
urlgrabber.

If you are building .deb or .rpm packages for bzr, please don't
include these libraries but instead package them separately and depend
on that.


Installation
------------

The best way to install bzr is to symlink the ``bzr`` command onto a
directory on your path.  For example::

  ln -s ~/work/bzr/bzr ~/bin/bzr

If you use a symlink for this, Python will be able to automatically
find the bzr libraries.  Otherwise you must ensure they are listed on
your $PYTHONPATH.

After installing, please run the test suite to identify any problems
on your platform::

  ./bzr selftest

If you use the setup.py script then bzr will be installed into the
specified path.  In this case you must install ElementTree and
urlgrabber separately.
