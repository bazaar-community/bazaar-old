README for Bazaar 0.9
=====================

Bazaar is a decentralized revision control system, designed to be easy
for developers and end users alike.

To install Bazaar from source, follow the instructions in the INSTALL
file. Otherwise, you may want to check your distribution package manager
for ready-to-install packages, or http://bazaar-vcs.org/DistroDownloads.

To learn how to use Bazaar, check the documentation in the doc/ directory.
Once installed, you can also run 'bzr help'. An always up-to-date and more
complete set of documents can be found in the Bazaar website, at:

    http://bazaar-vcs.org/Documentation

Bazaar is written in Python, and is sponsored by Canonical Limited, the
founders of Ubuntu and Launchpad. Bazaar is Free Software, and is released
under the GNU General Public License.

Bazaar was formerly known as Bazaar-NG, and some documentation still uses
that old name. Also, since the Bazaar binary is called "bzr", many times this
shorter name is used instead (like Subversion/svn and Mercurial/hg).

Bazaar highlights
=================

  * Easy to use and intuitive.

    Only five commands are needed to do all basic operations, and all
    commands have documentation accessible via 'bzr help command'.
    Bazaar's interface is also easy to lern for CVS and Subversion users.

  * Robust and reliable.

    Bazaar is developed under an extensive test suite. Branches can be
    checked and verified for integrity at any time, and revisions can be
    signed with PGP/GnuPG.

 * Publish branches with HTTP.

   Branches can be hosted on an HTTP server with no need for special
   software on the server side. Branches can be uploaded by bzr itself
   over SSH (SFTP), or with rsync.

 * Adapts to multiple environments.

   Bazaar runs on Linux and Windows, fully supports Unicode filenames,
   and suits different development models, including centralized.

 * Easily extended and customized.

   A rich Python interface is provided for extending and embedding,
   including a plugin interface. There are already many available plugins,
   most of them registered at http://bazaar-vcs.org/PluginRegistry.

 * Smart merging.

    Changes will never be merged more than once, conflicts will be
    minimized, and identical changes are dealt with well.

 * Vibrant and active community.

   Help with Bazaar is obtained easily, via the mailing list, or the IRC
   channel. Check http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrSupport for details.
